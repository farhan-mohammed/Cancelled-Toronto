Additionally, an upgrade and extension of the Scarborough rapid transit line to Malvern using newer intermediate capacity transit system technology was included in this plan, with plans eventually changing to a refurbishment of the line to utilise the same light rail technology proposed to be utilised on the other Transit City lines.
