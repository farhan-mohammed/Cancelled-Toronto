While Rob Ford maintained that the extensions could\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbe built using funds from private-public partnerships, it quickly became apparent that other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trevenue tools would be necessary to raise funds for the project, with Gordon Chong, head of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe TTC’s investment division suggesting road tolls, congestion charges, and development\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfees.<sup>13</sup> By June 2011, further study into the project found the estimated cost\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twould be $500 million more than originally pegged at, now totalling $4.7 billion.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<sup>14</sup>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOpposition to the project from within the TTC and the city also developed, beginning with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTTC chief general manager Gary Webster who refused to support the Sheppard subway\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\textensions, much to the ire of mayor Rob Ford, whose allies on the TTC board later fired\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGary Webster.<sup>15</sup> Then, following a series of victories in cancelling proposed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbudget cuts, Toronto city councillors led by TTC chair Karen Stintz began calling for a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcompromise transit plan, one that would see the original plan for an Eglinton LRT running\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tunderground between Keele Street and Laird Drive only, with a surface right-of-way for the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trest of the route.<sup>16</sup> In a new transit plan spearheaded by Karen Stintz, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsavings from the Eglinton LRT would be utilised to extend the Sheppard subway eastwards two\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstations to Victoria Park Avenue, with remaining funds spent on some sort of rapid transit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton Finch Avenue West.<sup>17</sup> Costs saved from avoiding tunnelling were estimated to be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tas much as $1.5 billion.<sup>18</sup> Her plan, debated in council in early February of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2012, restored the original Transit City plans for the Finch West and Eglinton LRTs, while\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpausing plans for a Sheppard subway in anticipation of recommendations from an expert panel\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton whether surface light rail or underground subway technology would be more effective.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<sup>19</sup> Soon after, city staff concluded that Rob Ford’s plan to almost exclusively\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tutilise private investment towards extensions of the Sheppard subway were unviable, with a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfunding gap of almost $1 billion on the section between Don Mills Station and Scarborough\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCentre Station alone.<sup>20</sup>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t)}\r\n\t\t\t\t/>\r\n\t\t\t\t<ImgTextBelow\r\n\t\t\t\t\timg=\"\"\r\n\t\t\t\t\ttext={() => (\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAs funding issues for the Sheppard subway continued to arise, city council voted to restore\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\toriginal plans for provincially-funded light rail lines on Sheppard, Finch, and Eglinton\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAvenues.{' '}\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t)}\r\n\t\t\t\t/>\r\n\t\t\t\t<TwoColumn\r\n\t\t\t\t\ttext={() => (\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFinally, with the release of the report in mid-March of 2012 showing that light rail\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttechnology would be more effective, council voted 24-19 to restore the previous funded plan\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor light rail on Sheppard East, Finch West, and Eglinton Avenues, much to the dismay of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmayor.<sup>21</sup>Appealing to the province, which would have wholly funded the $8.4\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbillion light rail plan, Rob Ford urged the province not to fund the plan, which was denied.<sup>22</sup>Attempts\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto revive the subway-focused plan through a city-wide referendum were unsuccessful, as were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tefforts to delay the light rail plan, which’s development was transferred from the TTC to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe province through Metrolinx.<sup>23</sup>Construction on light rail would begin on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSheppard Avenue East in 2014 and Finch Avenue West in 2015, which along with the then\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\talready under-construction Eglinton LRT would see completion in 2020.<sup>24</sup>In the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tend, the Sheppard East LRT was further delayed, deferred, and eventually replaced with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproposals for a future extension of the Sheppard subway in 2019, while the Finch West LRT\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbegan preparatory construction in 2019, with a completion date set for 2023.<sup>25</sup>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe saga for which the Metrolinx/Toronto Transit Plan was created was ultimately a blip from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe province’s original plan for a watered-down Transit City proposal. Although certain\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\telements of the Metrolinx/Toronto Transit Plan from 2011 survive today through the current\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProgressive Conservative administration’s plan for an eventual extension of the Sheppard\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsubway eastwards, such a project is neither funded or a priority. Meanwhile, Rob Ford’s\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvision for a fully-underground Eglinton LRT was never realized, with current construction on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta mixed-grade LRT planned for completion in fall of 2021. Despite so, the Metrolinx/Toronto\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTransit Plan represented the culmination of previous transit plans such as the Rapid Transit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExpansion Program and Network 2011, which foresaw the construction of a complete Sheppard\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsubway as well as grade-separated rapid transit on Eglinton Avenue West.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t)}\r\n\t\t\t\t/>\r\n\t\t\t\t<h1 className=\"body__text-h1\">Footnotes</h1>\r\n\t\t\t\t{renderFootnotes()}\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t);\r\n\t}\r\n\trender() {\r\n\t\treturn (\r\n\t\t\t<WebsiteLayout>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div className=\"body-con\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>{this.renderView()}</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>{this.renderText()}</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t</WebsiteLayout>\r\n\t\t);\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
