expansion in Toronto and the\r\n\t\t\t\tsurrounding region, with the project’s effect on relieving the capacity strains on existing downtown\r\n\t\t\t\tsubway infrastructure a prerequisite for projects such as extending the Yonge subway northwards to\r\n\t\t\t\tRichmond Hill.<sup>25</sup> After the election of a new Progressive Conservative provincial government,\r\n\t\t\t\texisting transit proposals in Toronto were studied, resulting in key changes proposed to the Relief\r\n\t\t\t\tLine.<sup>26</sup> The new line, designated the Ontario Line, would roughly follow the same corridor as\r\n\t\t\t\tthe Relief Line but with extensions to the north-east towards the Eglinton LRT’s Science Centre Station\r\n\t\t\t\tand south-west towards Exhibition GO Station.<sup>27</sup> A different alignment would be utilised, with\r\n\t\t\t\tthe Ontario Line running from Exhibition GO Station and following the rail corridor eastwards before\r\n\t\t\t\tturning northwards on Bathurst Street, then westwards onto Queen Street.<sup>28</sup> From there, the\r\n\t\t\t\tline would run through the downtown core with interchanges to the existing Yonge-University line before\r\n\t\t\t\tveering south from Queen Street at approximately Parliament Street towards the West Don Lands\r\n\t\t\t\tneighbourhood before curving east to follow the rail corridor to Pape Avenue.<sup>29</sup> Then, the\r\n\t\t\t\tsubway would follow Pape Avenue to Millwood Road, where it would cross the Don Valley and follow Don\r\n\t\t\t\tMills Road through the dense neighbourhoods of Thorncliffe Park and Flemingdon Park to the currently\r\n\t\t\t\tunder construction Science Centre Station, with a total of 15 stations along the entire line and only\r\n\t\t\t\tfollow approximately three kilometres of the Relief Line’s route.<sup>30</sup> Additionally, smaller,\r\n\t\t\t\tlighter, and automated trains that could run in smaller headways would be used instead of TTC subway\r\n\t\t\t\trolling stock, making the proposed line independent of the existing TTC subway system.<sup>31</sup>{' '}\r\n\t\t\t\tCost- and time-savings were touted by building above-ground in several areas including a crossing over\r\n\t\t\t\tthe Don River, as well as following the Lakeshore East and Stouffville lines rail corridor instead of\r\n\t\t\t\ttunnelling underground.<sup>32</sup> The line would cost an estimated $10.9 billion and utilise a\r\n\t\t\t\tprivate-public partnership procurement model.<sup>33</sup> Expected to open in 2027, the Ontario Line\r\n\t\t\t\twas the centrepiece of the new government’s transit plan, and a precondition for the government’s other\r\n\t\t\t\ttransit projects including the extension of the Yonge subway to Richmond Hill, a three stop extension of\r\n\t\t\t\tthe Bloor-Danforth line through Scarborough, and an extension of the under-construction Eglinton LRT to\r\n\t\t\t\tPearson Airport, all of which would add additional riders to a strained Yonge subway without the Ontario\r\n\t\t\t\tLine.<sup>34</sup> Although the Relief Line was effectively cancelled with the April 2018 announcement,\r\n\t\t\t\tthe Ontario Line is expected to fulfill many of the same objectives: providing relief to the\r\n\t\t\t\tover-capacity Yonge subway, promoting social equity by bringing rapid transit to underserviced\r\n\t\t\t\tneighbourhoods, and bringing connectivity with a variety of other transit initiatives.\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t);\r\n\t\treturn (\r\n\t\t\t<div className=\"body__text-con\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<h1 className=\"body__text-h1 body__text-h11980\">Relief
