'}\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCity residents in the borough of Scarborough were especially critical to the Relief Line, with a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplurality of residents supporting the one-stop extension of the Bloor-Danforth line to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tScarborough City Centre as the top transit priority for the city in 2016.<sup>19</sup> The high\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcost of the project, estimated at $6.8 billion in May of 2017, was not fully funded by the time\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe project was cancelled in April of 2019, while the controversial $3.2 billion one-stop\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tScarborough subway extension was, or was nearing it.<sup>20</sup>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlthough both provincial and federal administrations had thrown their support towards the Relief\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLine project as far as providing piecemeal bits of funding towards its planning and design work,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe project was left unfunded until it was replaced with the Ontario Line project in April of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2019.<sup>21</sup> The relative helplessness for the City of Toronto to fund transit priorities\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithout significant provincial and federal funding was exacerbated by the revenue tools\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tavailable to the city – excluding unpopular suggestions to increase property taxes.<sup>22</sup>{' '}\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAn attempt by the City of Toronto to toll its
