The highlights for phase one – a Sheppard\n\t\t\t\tsubway between Yonge Street and Don Mills Road, a subway on Eglinton Avenue West from Eglinton West\n\t\t\t\tStation in the east to a new “York City Centre” located at Black Creek Drive in the west, and eventually\n\t\t\t\tto Pearson Airport, an extended Spadina subway reaching York University, and an extension to the\n\t\t\t\tScarborough rapid transit line.<sup>1</sup>\n\t\t\t\t<br />\n\t\t\t\t<br /> This first phase of the plan would cost $2.5 billion and create 50,000 jobs, with $1.5 billion\n\t\t\t\tfrom the province, $500 million from Metro Toronto, and $500 million from the private sector.\n\t\t\t\t<sup>2</sup> The plan, released at the end of the early 1990s recession, was seen as both a jobs creator\n\t\t\t\tand a way to rebuild ridership on the TTC subway system, which had fallen over 15 per cent between 1988\n\t\t\t\tto 1993.<sup>3</sup>\n\t\t\t\t<br />\n\t\t\t\t<br />\n\t\t\t\tAt the core of the NDP’s new plan was many of the same projects found in both the Let’s Move and Network\n\t\t\t\t2011 plans: A Sheppard subway was made a priority in this plan, with provincial funding to match, unlike\n\t\t\t\tthe previous conditional support for the line under the previous Liberal provincial government.\n\t\t\t\t<sup>4</sup> On Eglinton, plans for a busway were upgraded to a subway, pleasing municipal officials in\n\t\t\t\tthe surrounding area and especially those from the then City of York, where the first phase of the\n\t\t\t\tfuture subway line was to terminate in a new central business district dubbed “York City Centre”.\n\t\t\t\t<sup>5</sup>\n\t\t\t\t<br />\n\t\t\t\t<br /> Meanwhile, plans for a subway loop connecting the Yonge and Spadina subways were retained but\n\t\t\t\texpanded to include proposed stations at York University and with a more northerly alignment on Steeles\n\t\t\t\tAvenue rather than through the Finch hydro corridor as originally proposed.<sup>6</sup> Similarly, plans\n\t\t\t\tfor extensions to the Bloor-Danforth subway and Scarborough rapid transit lines were retained, with an\n\t\t\t\textension to Sherway Gardens on the Bloor-Danforth subway proposed as a second phase of the plan.\n\t\t\t\t<sup>7</sup>\n\t\t\t\t<div className=\"italy italybold\" style={{ padding: '0.5em' }}>\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Rapid Transit Expansion Program put a focus on four projects: An Eglinton West subway, a\n\t\t\t\t\tSheppard subway, an extension of the Scarborough rapid transit line, and an extension of the Spadina\n\t\t\t\t\tline to York University.\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t);\n\t\tconst paraTwo = () => (\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\tInvestment into these projects by the provincial government, Metro Toronto, and the private sector were\n\t\t\t\tto be funnelled through a new crown corporation, the Ontario Transportation Corporation, which with a\n\t\t\t\tbudget separate from the province’s revenues enabled the provincial government to proceed with projects\n\t\t\t\twithout directly increasing Ontario’s deficit.<sup>11</sup>\n\t\t\t\t<br />\n\t\t\t\t<br /> Following the recession, the provincial government’s deficit at the time – a record $10 billion\n\t\t\t\twas worrying for many and a key issue in the following 1995 provincial elections.<sup>12</sup> Likewise,\n\t\t\t\tmunicipal officials in Metro Toronto were concerned with the cost associated with the four subway\n\t\t\t\tprojects proposed and their effect on municipal finances, which would see cost-cutting on municipal\n\t\t\t\tprograms to support the 25 per cent municipal funding necessary for the projects.<sup>13</sup> Metro\n\t\t\t\tToronto staff had earlier recommended Metro Toronto council to approve only the Eglinton West subway and\n\t\t\t\tSpadina extension to York University, leading to clashes between the province and Toronto municipal\n\t\t\t\tofficials, with the province threatening to cut their share of funding for other municipal projects if\n\t\t\t\tonly two of the four projects were approved.<sup>14</sup>\n\t\t\t\t<br />\n\t\t\t\t<br />\n\t\t\t\tIn the end, both the Sheppard and Eglinton West subways were approved while the Spadina and Scarborough\n\t\t\t\trapid transit extensions, with little political support, were left in limbo.\n\t\t\t\t<sup>15</sup> A municipal election during the midst of the debate temporarily paused the discussion but\n\t\t\t\tboth projects were eventually voted against by Metro Toronto council, leading to calls for the province\n\t\t\t\tto take control of the TTC.<sup>16</sup> Several proposals reportedly investigated by the province\n\t\t\t\tincluded transferring ownership, planning, and day-to-day operation of the subways to GO Transit,\n\t\t\t\tleaving the TTC to run only streetcars and buses, taking over just the remaining two projects and\n\t\t\t\tfunding them through provincial funds only, or taking control of the TTC completely.\n\t\t\t\t<sup>17</sup>\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t);\n\t\treturn (\n\t\t\t<div className=\"body__text-con\">\n\t\t\t\t<h1 className=\"body__text-h1 body__text-h11980\">Rapid Transit Expansion
