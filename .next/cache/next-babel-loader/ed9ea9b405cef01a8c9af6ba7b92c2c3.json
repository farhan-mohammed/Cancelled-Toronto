The highlights for phase one – a\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSheppard subway between Yonge Street and Don Mills Road, a subway on Eglinton Avenue West from\r\n\t\t\t\t\tEglinton West Station in the east to a new “York City Centre” located at Black Creek Drive in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\twest, and eventually to Pearson Airport, an extended Spadina subway reaching York University, and an\r\n\t\t\t\t\textension to the Scarborough rapid transit line.<sup>1</sup> This first phase of the plan would cost\r\n\t\t\t\t\t$2.5 billion and create 50,000 jobs, with $1.5 billion from the province, $500 million from Metro\r\n\t\t\t\t\tToronto, and $500 million from the private sector.<sup>2</sup> The plan, released at the end of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tearly 1990s recession, was seen as both a jobs creator and a way to rebuild ridership on the TTC\r\n\t\t\t\t\tsubway system, which had fallen over 15 per cent between 1988 to 1993.<sup>3</sup>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAt the core of the NDP’s new plan was many of the same projects found in both the Let’s Move and\r\n\t\t\t\t\tNetwork 2011 plans: A Sheppard subway was made a priority in this plan, with provincial funding to\r\n\t\t\t\t\tmatch, unlike the previous conditional support for the line under the previous Liberal provincial\r\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernment.<sup>4</sup> On Eglinton, plans for a busway were upgraded to a subway, pleasing\r\n\t\t\t\t\tmunicipal officials in the surrounding area and especially those from the then City of York, where\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthe first phase of the future subway line was to terminate in a new central business district dubbed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t“York City Centre”.<sup>5</sup> Meanwhile, plans for a subway loop connecting the Yonge and Spadina\r\n\t\t\t\t\tsubways were retained but expanded to include proposed stations at York University and with a more\r\n\t\t\t\t\tnortherly alignment on Steeles Avenue rather than through the Finch hydro corridor as originally\r\n\t\t\t\t\tproposed.<sup>6</sup> Similarly, plans for extensions to the Bloor-Danforth subway and Scarborough\r\n\t\t\t\t\trapid transit lines were retained, with an extension to Sherway Gardens on the Bloor-Danforth subway\r\n\t\t\t\t\tproposed as a second phase of the plan.<sup>7</sup>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div className=\"italy italybold\" style={{ padding: '0.5em' }}>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Rapid Transit Expansion Program put a focus on four projects: An Eglinton West subway, a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSheppard subway, an extension of the Scarborough rapid transit line, and an extension of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSpadina line to York University.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div className=\"body_divide body_divideVL\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src={'/images/RTEPA.jpg'} alt=\"\" />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div className=\"body__img-p italy\" style={{ marginTop: '1em' }}>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe environmental assessment of the Eglinton West subway identified four new stations and an\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinterchange with the existing Spadina line at Eglinton West station, which was planned to be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trenamed Allen Station.
