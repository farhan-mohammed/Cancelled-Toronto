2011</h1>\r\n\t\t\t\t<h2 className=\"body__text-h2\">Evolved into Let’s Move (1990)</h2>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p className=\"body__text-p\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tNetwork 2011 was a 1985 plan by the Toronto Transit Commission for transit expansion, named for the\r\n\t\t\t\t\ttarget completion date of 2011. The plan focused on three new rapid transit lines: a subway along\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSheppard Avenue from Downsview in the west to Scarborough City Centre in the east, a new rapid\r\n\t\t\t\t\ttransit corridor on Eglinton Avenue West composed of express buses linking Mississauga to Eglinton\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWest Station, and a downtown subway between Union Station and Pape Station.<sup>1</sup> Furthermore,\r\n\t\t\t\t\tan extension of the Spadina line from Wilson Station to the Downsview Area would allow for transfers\r\n\t\t\t\t\tbetween the Yonge-University-Spadina line and the future Sheppard subway.<sup>2</sup> All-in-all,\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthe plan would cost $2.7 billion, 25 per cent paid for by the Metro Toronto government and 75 per\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcent from the provincial government.<sup>3</sup>\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p className=\"body__text-p\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tApproved by Metro Toronto Council by 1986, the plan would be implemented in phases, with council\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdeciding on a subway on Sheppard Avenue from Yonge Street to Victoria Park Avenue as the priority,\r\n\t\t\t\t\tmuch to the dismay of municipal officials in Etobicoke, York, and Peel Region who wanted rapid\r\n\t\t\t\t\ttransit on Eglinton Avenue first.<sup>4</sup> Officials from the three municipal bodies were further\r\n\t\t\t\t\tappalled at the plan’s commitment to construct only a busway on Eglinton, rather than a light rail\r\n\t\t\t\t\tline or a subway, with the plan only specifying that it could be replaced with a subway –\r\n\t\t\t\t\teventually.<sup>5</sup> The plan saw further opposition from surrounding municipal and regional\r\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernments including York, Peel, and Durham Regions who sought funding for their transportation\r\n\t\t\t\t\tplans centred around the then proposed Highway 407, and who saw Network 2011 as competition for such\r\n\t\t\t\t\tfunding.<sup>6</sup>\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p className=\"body__text-p\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tUltimately, difficulties in funding the plan quickly derailed the timelines proposed in the plan.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe then-Liberal provincial government – who was not involved in the development of the Network 2011\r\n\t\t\t\t\tplan, baulked at the $75 million a year from the province necessary for a full build-out and decided\r\n\t\t\t\t\tto conduct a full study of all transit proposals in the province.<sup>7</sup> Completed in May of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t1988, the report downgraded funding priority of the Sheppard subway in favour of expanding GO\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTransit services and extending the Spadina line towards York Region.<sup>8</sup> By then, the cost\r\n\t\t\t\t\tfor completing a Sheppard subway from Yonge Street to Victoria Park Avenue had more than doubled\r\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom a 1985 estimate of $500 million to an estimate of $1.1 billion in 1989.<sup>9</sup> Come 1990 –\r\n\t\t\t\t\tan election year, the (eventually defeated) Liberals kept the Sheppard subway on life support by\r\n\t\t\t\t\tsupporting the project only if a portion of the project could be paid for through private sector\r\n\t\t\t\t\tinvestment and without disrupting funding for their transit plan, dubbed “Let’s Move”.<sup>10</sup>{' '}\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAlso retained was plans for rapid transit on Eglinton in the form of a busway to Peel Region but a\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdowntown subway and a complete Sheppard subway from Downsview to Scarborough City Centre were\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdropped.<sup>11</sup>\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p className=\"body__text-p\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAlthough much of what Network 2011 proposed was never built in the timeframes proposed, elements of\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthe plan were highly influential to the plans of subsequent provincial and municipal governments and\r\n\t\t\t\t\tremain so. Today, plans for a downtown subway continue to be studied while rapid transit on Eglinton\r\n\t\t\t\t\thas taken the form of light rail, currently under-construction and planned for a 2021 opening.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<h1 className=\"body__text-h1\">Footnotes</h1>\r\n\t\t\t\t<ol className=\"footnotes__list\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li className=\"footnotes__item\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSmith, Mitchell. “TTC Urges $2.7 Billion Expansion.” Toronto Star, October 1, 1985, sec.
