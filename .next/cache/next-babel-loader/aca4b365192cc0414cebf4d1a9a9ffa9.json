The highlights for phase one – a Sheppard\r\n\t\t\t\tsubway between Yonge Street and Don Mills Road, a subway on Eglinton Avenue West from Eglinton West\r\n\t\t\t\tStation in the east to a new “York City Centre” located at Black Creek Drive in the west, and eventually\r\n\t\t\t\tto Pearson Airport, an extended Spadina subway reaching York University, and an extension to the\r\n\t\t\t\tScarborough rapid transit line.<sup>1</sup> This first phase of the plan would cost $2.5 billion and\r\n\t\t\t\tcreate 50,000 jobs, with $1.5 billion from the province, $500 million from Metro Toronto, and $500\r\n\t\t\t\tmillion from the private sector.<sup>2</sup> The plan, released at the end of the early 1990s recession,\r\n\t\t\t\twas seen as both a jobs creator and a way to rebuild ridership on the TTC subway system, which had\r\n\t\t\t\tfallen over 15 per cent between 1988 to 1993.<sup>3</sup>\r\n\t\t\t\tAt the core of the NDP’s new plan was many of the same projects found in both the Let’s Move and Network\r\n\t\t\t\t2011 plans: A Sheppard subway was made a priority in this plan, with provincial funding to match, unlike\r\n\t\t\t\tthe previous conditional support for the line under the previous Liberal provincial government.\r\n\t\t\t\t<sup>4</sup> On Eglinton, plans for a busway were upgraded to a subway, pleasing municipal officials in\r\n\t\t\t\tthe surrounding area and especially those from the then City of York, where the first phase of the\r\n\t\t\t\tfuture subway line was to terminate in a new central business district dubbed “York City Centre”.\r\n\t\t\t\t<sup>5</sup> Meanwhile, plans for a subway loop connecting the Yonge and Spadina subways were retained\r\n\t\t\t\tbut expanded to include proposed stations at York University and with a more northerly alignment on\r\n\t\t\t\tSteeles Avenue rather than through the Finch hydro corridor as originally proposed.<sup>6</sup>{' '}\r\n\t\t\t\tSimilarly, plans for extensions to the Bloor-Danforth subway and Scarborough rapid transit lines were\r\n\t\t\t\tretained, with an extension to Sherway Gardens on the Bloor-Danforth subway proposed as a second phase\r\n\t\t\t\tof the plan.<sup>7</sup>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div className=\"italy italybold\" style={{ padding: '0.5em' }}>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Rapid Transit Expansion Program put a focus on four projects: An Eglinton West subway, a\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSheppard subway, an extension of the Scarborough rapid transit line, and an extension of the Spadina\r\n\t\t\t\t\tline to York University.\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t</span>\r\n\t\t);\r\n\t\tconst paraTwo = () => (\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\tInvestment into these projects by the provincial government, Metro Toronto, and the private sector were\r\n\t\t\t\tto be funnelled through a new crown corporation, the Ontario Transportation Corporation, which with a\r\n\t\t\t\tbudget separate from the province’s revenues enabled the provincial government to proceed with projects\r\n\t\t\t\twithout directly increasing Ontario’s deficit.<sup>11</sup> Following the recession, the provincial\r\n\t\t\t\tgovernment’s deficit at the time – a record $10 billion was worrying for many and a key issue in the\r\n\t\t\t\tfollowing 1995 provincial elections.<sup>12</sup> Likewise, municipal officials in Metro Toronto were\r\n\t\t\t\tconcerned with the cost associated with the four subway projects proposed and their effect on municipal\r\n\t\t\t\tfinances, which would see cost-cutting on municipal programs to support the 25 per cent municipal\r\n\t\t\t\tfunding necessary for the projects.<sup>13</sup> Metro Toronto staff had earlier recommended Metro\r\n\t\t\t\tToronto council to approve only the Eglinton West subway and Spadina extension to York University,\r\n\t\t\t\tleading to clashes between the province and Toronto municipal officials, with the province threatening\r\n\t\t\t\tto cut their share of funding for other municipal projects if only two of the four projects were\r\n\t\t\t\tapproved.<sup>14</sup>\r\n\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\tIn the end, both the Sheppard and Eglinton West subways were approved while the Spadina and Scarborough\r\n\t\t\t\trapid transit extensions, with little political support, were left in limbo.\r\n\t\t\t\t<sup>15</sup> A municipal election during the midst of the debate temporarily paused the discussion but\r\n\t\t\t\tboth projects were eventually voted against by Metro Toronto council, leading to calls for the province\r\n\t\t\t\tto take control of the TTC.<sup>16</sup> Several proposals reportedly investigated by the province\r\n\t\t\t\tincluded transferring ownership, planning, and day-to-day operation of the subways to GO Transit,\r\n\t\t\t\tleaving the TTC to run only streetcars and buses, taking over just the remaining two projects and\r\n\t\t\t\tfunding them through provincial funds only, or taking control of the TTC completely.\r\n\t\t\t\t<sup>17</sup>\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t);\r\n\t\treturn (\r\n\t\t\t<div className=\"body__text-con\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<h1 className=\"body__text-h1 body__text-h11980\">Rapid Transit

Not only did it refine and build upon plans studied for almost a decade, beginning\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith Network 2011, but it also provided the necessary funding for construction. Although never\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfully realized, the basis of the planning undertaken through this plan formed the first major\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\textension to the TTC subway system for over two decades, with the Sheppard subway between Yonge\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tStreet and Don Mills Road opening in 2003. Meanwhile, key elements of the plan including a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubway on Eglinton Avenue West and extensions to the Spadina line to York University have been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trevisited by later governments, with the Eglinton Crosstown LRT opening in 2021 to have a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsimilar routing and station placement as the planned Eglinton West subway, while an extension of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Spadina line with stops at York University opening in 2017.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<h1 className=\"body__text-h1\">Footnotes</h1>\r\n\t\t\t\t{footnotes()}\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t);\r\n\t}\r\n\trender() {\r\n\t\treturn (\r\n\t\t\t<WebsiteLayout>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div className=\"body-con\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>{this.renderView()}</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>{this.renderText()}</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t</WebsiteLayout>\r\n\t\t);\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
