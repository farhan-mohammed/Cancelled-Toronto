contending for funding.<sup>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t18\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</sup>{' '}\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCity residents in the borough of Scarborough were especially critical to the Relief Line, with a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplurality of residents supporting the one-stop extension of the Bloor-Danforth line to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tScarborough City Centre as the top transit priority for the city in 2016.<sup>19</sup> The high\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcost of the project, estimated at $6.8 billion in May of 2017, was not fully funded by the time\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe project was cancelled in April of 2019, while the controversial $3.2 billion one-stop\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tScarborough subway extension was, or was nearing it.<sup>20</sup>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />Although both provincial and federal administrations had thrown their support towards the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRelief Line project as far as providing piecemeal bits of funding towards its planning and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdesign work, the project was left unfunded until it was replaced with the Ontario Line project\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin April of 2019.<sup>21</sup> The relative helplessness for the City of Toronto to fund transit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpriorities without significant provincial and federal funding was exacerbated by the revenue\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttools available to the city – excluding unpopular suggestions to increase property taxes.<sup>22</sup>{' '}\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAn attempt by the City of Toronto to toll its municipal expressways including the Gardiner\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tExpressway and Don Valley Parkway – with revenues going towards maintaining tolled routes and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfunding transit, was quashed by the provincial government, which recognized the political\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunpopularity of such tolls in seat-rich suburban communities outside Toronto.<sup>23</sup>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<ImgTextRightBelow\r\n\t\t\t\t\timg={images[2]}\r\n\t\t\t\t\ttitle={<span>Moss
