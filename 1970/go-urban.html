Beginning with delays to the demonstration line on the CNE, costs of the line soon rose dramatically from a budgeted $17 million to $25 million.<sup>40</sup> Even after cutting “frills” and even one of the four stations from the line, construction was delayed past the 1975 opening date.<sup>41</sup> In West Germany, where development of the technology was taking place, work was delayed as issues towards creating a working prototype continued.<sup>42</sup> A scheduled trip by a provincial delegation was postponed from June 1974 to September 1974.<sup>43</sup> Soon after the September visit, the completed prototype was damaged while testing as bugs continued to plague the system.<sup>44</sup> Then, on November 7th, 1974, it was revealed that the system was incapable of reliably handling curves, cancelling another visit by provincial and municipal officials and dignitaries from Los Angeles and drawing ridicule from opposition parties in the provincial legislature.<sup>45</sup> </span></span></div></div><div class="WC-item"><div class="WC-item_para-con"><span class="WC-item_para"><span>The final straw came a week later on November 14th, when funding for the development of Krauss-Maffei’s ICTS technology was halted by the West German government.<sup>46</sup> <!-- -->Krauss-Maffei was forced to withdraw from the GO-Urban project, and with the technology incomplete, GO-Urban was paused.<sup>47</sup> Under the conditions of withdrawal, the Ontario government was allowed to retain exclusive rights to patents and the technology, as well as use of a test track of the system operational in Munich, West Germany for just under two years.<sup>48</sup> The demonstration system under construction was cancelled, with a portion of the $25 million spent on the project to be refunded by Krauss-Maffei, while the rest of the lines planned under GO-Urban were put on hold pending further development of the technology by the province.<sup>49</sup></span></span></div></div><div class="WC-item"><div class="WC-item_para-con"><span class="WC-item_para"><span>Although provincial officials maintained that GO-Urban was not cancelled, the lines proposed as part of the project quickly faded into obscurity. One proposed line, the Malvern route, had a segment between the proposed Bloor-Danforth subway extension and Scarborough City Centre quickly replaced with plans for a light rail transit line using streetcars, similar to what was originally proposed by Metropolitan Toronto and the TTC.<sup>50</sup> The line would utilise new light rail vehicles developed by the same government agency tasked with GO-Urban, the Ontario Transportation Development Corporation, and would follow a similar route as what GO-Urban was planned to utilise.<sup>51</sup> Eventually, plans for that line would change as well, with the province pressuring Metropolitan Toronto and the TTC to replace the light rail vehicles planned to be utilised on the line with GO-Urban’s successor – Urban Transportation Development Corporation’s (previously known as the Ontario Transportation Development Corporation) ICTS.<sup>52</sup></span></span></div></div></div></div><div class=" WC "><div class="WC-left"><div class="WC-item"><div class="WC-item_ct">Coupled Light Rail Vehicle</div></div><div class="WC-item"><div class="WC-item_quote-con"><span class="WC-item_quote"><span>Light rail vehicles developed by the same Crown corporation tasked with research, development, and promotion of GO-Urban in Ontario were planned to be utilised for routes previously set for GO-Urban technology after its cancellation.<sup>50</sup> <!-- -->The vehicles, later dubbed the CLRV (Canadian Light Rail Vehicle), were planned to be run in coupled pairs, as pictured, in their own dedicated right-of-ways, although the eventual shift in plans to utilise ICTS technology meant neither ambitious happened.<sup>53</sup> The same vehicles were the workhorse for Toronto’s streetcar fleet for over 40 years before their retirement in late 2019.</span></span></div></div><div class="WC-item"><div class="WC-item_quote-con"><span class="WC-item_quote"><span>(David Cooper / Toronto Star) © Toronto Star, 1979.

Although the province’s persistence in the further development of the technology never resulted in the ambitious network of ICTS lines as originally proposed in GO-Urban (and other ICTS projects such as GO-ALRT), the eventual product for such a system first envisioned by GO-Urban has played a significant role in fulfilling the transit needs of other cities worldwide.</span></span></div></div></div></div><div class=" WC "><div class="WC-left"><div class="WC-item"><div class="WC-item_ct">footnotes</div></div></div><div class="WC-right"><div class="WC-item"><div class="WC-item_para-con"><span class="WC-item_para"><ol class="footnotes__list"><li class="footnotes__item">Canada.
