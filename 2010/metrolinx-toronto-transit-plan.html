transit plans in the city would shift yet again. While Transit City proposed light rail transit (LRT) running along several key thoroughfares in the city in a dedicated surface right-of-way, Rob Ford’s transit plan focused on building subways, with the extension of the Sheppard subway eastwards to Scarborough Centre Station and westwards to Downsview Station his number one focus.<sup>1</sup></span></span></div></div><div class="WC-item"><div class="WC-item_para-con"><span class="WC-item_para"><span>By the time of Transit City’s cancellation on the first day of taking office, the Sheppard East LRT was already under construction as construction crews began building a bridge for Stouffville line GO trains over Sheppard Avenue, work that was continued because of its necessity for either plan.<sup>2</sup> That left a handful of other funded Transit City and other Toronto transit projects in limbo including the proposed Finch West LRT running from Finch West Station on the yet-unopened Toronto-York Spadina Subway Extension to Humber College, the Eglinton LRT between approximately Black Creek Drive to Kennedy Station on the Bloor-Danforth Line, and the refurbishment and extension of the Scarborough rapid transit line from McCowan Station to Sheppard Avenue.<sup>3</sup></span></span></div></div></div></div><div class=" WC "><div class="WC-left"><div class="WC-item"><div class="WC-item_ct">Scarborough City Centre</div></div><div class="WC-item"><div class="WC-item_quote-con"><span class="WC-item_quote"><span>Development of Scarborough City Centre had increased significantly since a Sheppard subway to Scarborough City Centre was first proposed in 1985 through Network 2011.

Meanwhile, Rob Ford’s vision for a fully-underground Eglinton LRT was never realized, with current construction on a mixed-grade LRT planned for completion in fall of 2021. Despite so, the Metrolinx/Toronto Transit Plan represented the culmination of previous transit plans such as the Rapid Transit Expansion Program and Network 2011, which foresaw the construction of a complete Sheppard subway as well as grade-separated rapid transit on Eglinton Avenue West.</span></span></div></div></div></div><div class=" WC "><div class="WC-left"><div class="WC-item"><div class="WC-item_mt">footnotes</div></div></div><div class="WC-right"><div class="WC-item"><div class="WC-item_para-con"><span class="WC-item_para"><ol class="footnotes__list"><li class="footnotes__item">Kristin, Rushowy, and Kalinowski Tess. “Sheppard Not a Priority - Yet: Despite Ford&#x27;s Comments, Transit Plan Won&#x27;t Be Set until the New Year.” Toronto Star, December 22, 2010, sec.
