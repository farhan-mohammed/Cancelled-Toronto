Rapid transit through the downtown core had seen multiple iterations throughout history, stemming back to the first serious efforts to build rapid transit in Toronto. The proposed line would run from Osgoode Station, along Queen Street, before bending southwards to serve the proposed Unilever/East Harbour development in the east side of the city’s downtown. Then, it would curve north on Carlaw Avenue before shifting onto Pape Street, finally connecting with the Bloor-Danforth subway at Pape Station.</span></span></div></div><div class="WC-item"><div class="WC-item_para-con"><span class="WC-item_para"><span>The Relief Line project was a proposed 7.5-kilometre subway line running from Osgoode Station in the south-west to Pape Station in the north-east, connecting the busy Yonge-University line with the Bloor-Danforth line.<sup>1</sup> The necessity for another subway line leading into the central downtown area had been a crucial part of Toronto transit plans for over half a century, with the first concrete plans for east-west downtown rapid transit proposed by the TTC in 1946 as part of a subway plan referendum held during the 1946 Toronto municipal elections.<sup>2</sup> The approved proposal envisioned an underground streetcar line along Queen Street with tracks connecting to surface streetcar routes at Trinity Park in the west and Pape Street in the east.<sup>3</sup> Planned to be completed after the Yonge subway approved in the same referendum, planners shifted their focus on an east-west route on Bloor Street instead.<sup>4</sup></span></span></div></div><div class="WC-item"><div class="WC-item_para-con"><span class="WC-item_para"><span>Then, in 1985, the Downtown Rapid Transit Study as part of Network 2011 studied a subway from Pape Station in the north-east to approximately the intersection of Front Street and Spadina Avenue utilising the rail-corridors and Front Street as the alignment.<sup>5</sup> The planned project, poised to provide relief to the already overburdened Yonge subway line, was eventually cancelled as other projects took priority.<sup>6</sup> The approved 2016 Relief Line proposal shared many similarities with the one presented in Network 2011, but ran along Queen Street through the downtown, with eight station stops, three of those interchange stations.<sup>7</sup></span></span></div></div></div></div><div class="WC-center WC "><div class="WC-center"><div class="WC-item"><div class="WC-item_ct">Approved Alignment</div></div><div

class="WC-item_para"><span>The revival of planning for a downtown subway began with the 2008 publication of Metrolinx’s regional transportation plan, the Big Move, which foresaw the need for a “U” shaped subway running from an undetermined station along the Danforth section of the Bloor-Danforth line, south-west through downtown with connections with the Yonge and University subways, and north-west towards an undetermined station along the western section of the Bloor-Danforth line.<sup>8</sup></span></span></div></div><div class="WC-item"><div class="WC-item_para-con"><span class="WC-item_para"><span>Planned to be implemented within 25 years, plans for the line were accelerated as support from municipal and transit officials grew, and as capacity issues along the existing Yonge subway which the proposed line would help relieve worsened.<sup>9</sup> Updates to the regional transportation plan were undertaken in 2013 which reprioritized the core section of the project running from a station along the University subway to a station along the Bloor-Danforth line to be completed within 15 years.<sup>10</sup></span></span></div></div><div class="WC-item"><div class="WC-item_para-con"><span class="WC-item_para"><span>The proposed subway, dubbed the Downtown Relief Line because of its projected effect on providing relief to capacity strains on existing subway infrastructure, underwent studies for potential alignments starting in 2012 with the TTC’s Downtown Rapid Transit Expansion Study, with further refinement in 2014 with the start of the Relief Line Project Assessment undertaken by the City of Toronto and the TTC.<sup>11</sup></span></span></div></div><div class="WC-item"><div class="WC-item_para-con"><span class="WC-item_para"><span>A breakthrough in the planning of the Relief Line came in March 2016, with the identification and approval of a preferred corridor by Toronto city council.<sup>12</sup> The corridor, running from Pape Station to downtown Toronto using Pape Avenue and Queen or Richmond Streets was chosen because of its positive effects on several aspects considered: serving a wide range of destinations, connectivity with other transit initiatives, promotion of social equity, and lowest potential cost.<sup>13</sup></span></span></div></div><div class="WC-item"><div class="WC-item_para-con"><span class="WC-item_para"><span>An alignment within the corridor was eventually selected and approved by council in May 2017, with a line running from Pape Station to Osgoode Station via Pape Avenue, Carlaw Avenue, Eastern Avenue, and Queen Street and stations at Osgoode Station, Queen Station, Sherbourne Street, Sumach Street, Broadview Avenue, Carlaw Avenue, Gerrard Street, and Pape Station.<sup>14</sup> Besides interchanges with the Yonge-University and Bloor-Danforth lines at the existing Osgoode, Queen, and Pape Stations, stations with connections to future SmartTrack and GO Regional Express Rail services were planned at stations at Broadview Avenue and Gerrard Street.<sup>15</sup></span></span></div></div></div></div><div class=" WC "><div class="WC-left"><div

The proposal that replaced it, the Ontario Line, is expected to divert even more ridership from the Yonge subway because of its northern extension from Pape Station to the future Science Centre Station on Eglinton Avenue.<sup>27</sup></span></span></div></div><div class="WC-item"><div class="WC-item_quote-con"><span class="WC-item_quote"><span>&quot;Bloor Subway Station 2&quot; by Raysonho.
