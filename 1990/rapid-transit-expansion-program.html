was the culmination of the NDP provincial government’s study of the previous Liberal government’s Let’s Move transit plan. The highlights for phase one – a Sheppard subway between Yonge Street and Don Mills Road, a subway on Eglinton Avenue West from Eglinton West Station in the east to a new “York City Centre” located at Black Creek Drive in the west, and eventually to Pearson Airport, an extended Spadina subway reaching York University, and an extension to the Scarborough rapid transit line.<sup>1</sup></span></span></div></div><div class="WC-item"><div class="WC-item_para-con"><span class="WC-item_para"><span>This first phase of the plan would cost $2.5 billion and create 50,000 jobs, with $1.5 billion from the province, $500 million from Metro Toronto, and $500 million from the private sector.<sup>2</sup> The plan, released at the end of the early 1990s recession, was seen as both a jobs creator and a way to rebuild ridership on the TTC subway system, which had fallen over 15 per cent between 1988 to 1993.<sup>3</sup></span></span></div></div></div></div><div class=" WC "><div class="WC-left"><div class="WC-item"><div class="WC-item_ct">North York Centre</div></div><div class="WC-item"><div class="WC-item_quote-con"><span class="WC-item_quote"><span>The Sheppard subway was crucial to the then-city of North York and Metropolitan Toronto’s plan to build a downtown centered along Yonge Street.

Meanwhile, key elements of the plan including a subway on Eglinton Avenue West and extensions to the Spadina line to York University have been revisited by later governments, with the Eglinton Crosstown LRT opening in 2021 to have a similar routing and station placement as the planned Eglinton West subway, while an extension of the Spadina line with stops at York University opening in 2017.</div></span></div></div></div></div><div class=" WC "><div class="WC-left"><div class="WC-item"><div class="WC-item_ct">footnotes</div></div></div><div class="WC-right"><div class="WC-item"><div class="WC-item_para-con"><span class="WC-item_para"><ol class="footnotes__list"><li class="footnotes__item">Nicolaas Van Rijn and Royson James. “Rae Okays New Lines for Subway &#x27;Grand Slam&#x27;.” Toronto Star, February 9, 1993, sec.
